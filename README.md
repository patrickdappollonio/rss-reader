# `rss-reader`

Still under development

## TODO

* [ ] Parse the rest of the content into the correspondent structs or pointers
* [ ] Check the `Content` attribute and fetch n number of pictures, then verify if they're larger than a specific number
* [ ] Add a flag to fetch wether if we need to find `PreviewImage`s or not
* [ ] Use goroutines in any case to "read" the images in parallel
